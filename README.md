This project, developed as part of the Gelecek Hayalim initiative, explores gender equality in the workplace through data analytics and machine learning. 
Using a dataset from India containing variables such as age, experience, job role, education level, and salary (in INR), the analysis focuses on understanding salary disparities. 
Predictive models were built with and without the gender feature to highlight its impact. 
Future directions include advanced modeling techniques and fairness-driven approaches to promote inclusivity and equity.
